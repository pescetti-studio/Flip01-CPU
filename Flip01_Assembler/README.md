**Here’s everything related to the assembler for Flip01.**

Windows might flag it as a virus or some kind of dangerous software because I haven’t yet figured out how to avoid that issue. </br>
If you don’t trust it _(and you’d be totally right, the internet is a weird place)_, you can recompile everything from the source code.

I developed it using **Dev C++** as the IDE, not **Visual Studio**, but there shouldn’t be any compatibility issues.

If you just want to use the assembler, click on the _Flip01_Assembler.exe_ file.
If you want to modify something, you probably know better than we do how and what to change.

For any issues, bugs, or anything else, write to us at _pescettistudio@gmail.com_.
