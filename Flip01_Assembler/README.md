# The assembler

This program is responsible for **translating mnemonic instructions** _(load, sub, add$, etc.)_ **into their corresponding opcodes**, while also converting numeric values and memory references into formats understandable by the processor. <br />

The code should be written in the panel that, on startup, displays the message `write your text here` <br />
The conversion is automatically shown in the space below.<br />
**To disable the live machine code conversion**, simply press the corresponding button labeled `Live analysis enabled`. <br /> 
At that point, the button and interface will indicate that live translation has been paused. <br />
**To resume real-time conversion** or to view the corresponding translation, press the button again. <br /> 
<br />
To: 
+ **open a text file _(.txt)_ containing code you want to analyze**
+ **save the current file**
+ **clear the content and start a new file**
just click the corresponding buttons. <br />
After specifying the name or the path for the current file, it wonâ€™t be necessary to do so again, and all subsequent saves will be made to that file. This continues until the user initializes a new file via the `New Code` button. <br /> <br />

**To add a comment to the code**, use the following syntax:
```
 // Comment
```
Comments can only be added at the beginning of a new line.
<br />

For a detailed analysis of the possible **errors and warnings** generated by the assembler during the analysis of user-written code, please refer to the Flip01 manual.

The assembler was developed in **C/C++** using the **Dev C++ IDE**.

> [!WARNING]
> The assembler is only compatible with Windows-based operating systems
