//Program that performs a countdown from 10 to 0

load AX counter

// This is the start of the code section that will be executed until the counter reaches 0
loop:

// Subtract 1 from the AX register which holds the current value of the counter. Alternatively, you can use (dec AX) for the same clock cycles
sub$ AX 1

// Is AX equal to 0 after subtraction?
cmp$ AX 0

// If yes, jump to the final part of the program identified by the "end" label

jmp loop

// End of the program. This is executed only if the counter (whose value is stored in AX) has indeed reached 0
